**I. Analysis of the Vibration Problem**

x(0) = a,  x'(0) = b,  
For the physical significance of the second-order ODE, please study it first.  
Please note what each coefficient represents, and make sure you understand it.

- m (mass): The mass of the object, which affects the object's inertia.  
- c (damping coefficient): The magnitude of the damping, which influences the rate of decay of the oscillation.  
- k (spring constant): The stiffness of the spring, which affects the elastic restoring force of the object.  
- f (external force): The external force acting on the object.  
- x(0): The initial displacement.  
- x'(0): The initial velocity
