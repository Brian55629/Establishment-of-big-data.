**I. Analysis of the Vibration Problem**

x(0) = a,  x'(0) = b,  
For the physical significance of the second-order ODE, please study it first.  
Please note what each coefficient represents, and make sure you understand it.

- m (mass): The mass of the object, which affects the object's inertia.  
- c (damping coefficient): The magnitude of the damping, which influences the rate of decay of the oscillation.  
- k (spring constant): The stiffness of the spring, which affects the elastic restoring force of the object.  
- f (external force): The external force acting on the object.  
- x(0): The initial displacement.  
- x'(0): The initial velocity

II. Establishment of Big Data

Consider different combinations of m, c, k, a, b, and f = constant or f = f(t), and generate a solution for tens of thousands of datasets.
Solve using MATLAB's Runge-Kutta method.
When using the Runge-Kutta method to solve second-order ordinary differential equations, you need to convert them into a system of first-order equations. Below is an example code in MATLAB for solving such systems of equations using the Runge-Kutta 4th-order method.
